# CMC-Senate-Attendance-System
My friend and I took on a projected where we were tasked with writing code for an attendance system for our school's student government, specifically the student senate. Our program is used to keep track of student attendance and senatorship to senate meetings. If a student is a senator they can vote on school related issues.  Senators lose their senatorship if they miss three meetings in a row, and non-senators become senators if they attend three meetings in a row.

A magnetic card reader was used to obtain the id of Claremont College students. If the student is already in the database their attendance will be recorded and their senator status updated if necessary. If the student is not in the database and has a vaild id number, he/she is prompted to enter their first and last name into the system, and is then added to the database.

An excel file was used as our "database," where senator information, senatorship, and dates of attendance are exported to once the user clicks the save button (when a senate meeting has started and attendance has been taken). The data in the excel file is also imported every-time the application (JAR file) is reopened and updated once the user clicks save.
