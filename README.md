# CMC-Senate-Attendance-System
My friend and I were tasked with writing code for a senate attendance system to keep track of attendance and senatorship. This code was exported to a JAR file, and is now used by my school's student government, specifically the student senate. If a student is a senator they can vote on school related issues. Senators lose their senatorship if they miss three meetings in a row, and non-senators become senators if they attend three meetings in a row. An excel file was used as our "database," where senator information, senatorship, and dates of attendance are exported to once the user clicks the save button (when a senate meeting has started and attendance has been taken). The data in the excel file is also imported every-time the application (JAR file) is reopened and updated once the user clicks save.
